tutorial:
  notAuthed: Sorry to say your Slack account isn't tied to a registered club. If you know you're a club leader this is probably just an error you can resolve by letting the staff know.
  start: >
    Hey <@${this.user}>! I'm a tool you can use to manage & get resources for your club.
  finished: >
    That's it for the tutorial!
  renameChannel:
    start: >
      Let's rename your club's channel to something more presentable (it's
      currently <#${this.channel}>). Run \`/rename-channel new-channel-name\`
      (but with a name you actually want to use).
    finished: >
      Fantastic! Your channel is your own space for your co-leaders and club members. You can rename it at anytime.
  getSticker:
    start: |
      Now let's get some goodies. Hack Club has a long tradition of club stickers (hackclub.com/stickers), and we want to get some shipped to you ASAP.
      Run \`/get sticker envelope\` to get a envelope of stickers.
    finished: |
      Great! Now that you've ordered one sticker envelope you can always order another– we're happy to give more stickers to clubs in need.
      There are a couple more promos available, but some of them are only available to clubs that are actively meeting. We'll play around with that later on in the tutorial, but we'll need to record a meeting.
  meetingAdd:
    start: |
      Let's record a meeting. Normally you'd do this after each of your meetings, but to get through the tutorial we'll have you record 2 right now.
      No worries if you haven't met yet, just make something up for the tutorial– we'll cover how to remove meetings later on.

      Record a first meeting today:
        - \`/meeting-add today, 24 members\`
    progress: Great! Now add another \`/meeting-add last friday, 21 members\`
    finished: 
      Great! Now that you've got meetings recorded, your club is "active". Active clubs get access to a couple exclusive tools and services.
  getGrant:
    start: There's a whole list of promos only available to active clubs. Request the \`/get github grant\`.
    finished: Great! You can always see a list of promos available by running \`/get\`.
  meetingTime:
    start: We're close now! There's one last thing in this tutorial. If you run \`/meeting-time\`, it'll let me know when your meetings are held. Once your meeting time is set I'll quickly check in after every meeting to make sure you record it.
    finished: If you ever need me to silence check-in notifications for a while (ie. spring break), all you have to do is type \`/meeting-time\` with a time after your spring break– I won't post any check-in messages until that date.
