  notAuthed: Sorry to say your Slack account isn't tied to a registered club. If you know you're a club leader this is probably just an error you can resolve by letting the staff know.
  start: >
    Hey <@${this.user}>! I'm a tool you can use to manage & get resources for your club.
  finished: >
    That's it for the tutorial!
  renameChannel:
    start: >
      Let's rename your club's channel to something more presentable (it's
      currently <#${this.channel}>). Run \`/rename-channel new-channel-name\`

  getSticker:

      Run \`/get sticker envelope\` to get a envelope of stickers.
    finished: |
      Great! Now that you've ordered one sticker envelope you can always order another– we're happy to give more stickers to clubs in need.
      There are a couple more promos available, but some of them are only available to clubs that are actively meeting. We'll play around with that later on in the tutorial, but we'll need to record a meeting.
  meetingAdd:
    start: |
      Let's record a meeting. Normally you'd do this after each of your meetings, but to get through the tutorial we'll have you record 2 right now.
      No worries if you haven't met yet, just make something up for the tutorial– we'll cover how to remove meetings later on.

      Record a first meeting today:
        - \`/meeting-add today, 24 members\`
    progress: Great! Now add another \`/meeting-add last friday, 21 members\`
    finished: 
      Great! Now that you've got meetings recorded, your club is "active". Active clubs get access to a couple exclusive tools and services.

      At the start of the 2020 school year we gave out Zoom Pro accounts to a single leader from each club through this command. Now we've built an even better platform that everyone in the Slack can use to run Zoom Pro meetings.

      You can now start a Zoom Pro meeting anywhere in the Slack by running \`/z\`.

      - "VRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM:racecar: <- that's our Zoom account racing towards our license limit. Could someone lay down some track for me?"
      - Not crazy time sensitive, but could you upgrade the Zoom licenses? <@${this.user}> just got an account & now we have ${this.hosts-this.usage} license left. https://cloud-1desdbmuy.vercel.app/bhb-gg.gif

      Your club doesn't have the "active" status (run \`/stats\` to see your
      club's status and \`/meeting-add\` to record meetings). While not
      required for grants, having "active" status will go a long way in
      getting your grant approved. If you've forgotten to add any meetings
      you can record them now before your grant is reviewed by staff.
