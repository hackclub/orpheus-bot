    Hey <@${this.user}>! Welcome to my tutorial. First thing's first, let's

    new-channel-name\` (with your own channel name)
  alreadyStarted: >

  renamedChannel: >
    Now that we've renamed <#${this.channel}>, I'll show you how to record a
    club meeting. First, I'll need to know when your first club meeting is.
    You can show me by typing \`/meeting-time next tuesday at 3 pm\`.

    Great! Now I'll roleplay what will happen right after your first meeting
    by posting in <#${this.channel}>
